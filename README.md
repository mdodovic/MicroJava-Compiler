# MicroJava-Compiler

**MicroJava** is a *high-level programming language*, *similar*, but *simpler* than **Java**.
Similarly to Java, MicroJava source files are compiled to **bytecode**, which is then executed by a **virtual machine** (**MicroJava Virtual Machine**). MicroJava VM is a simple *interpretative emulator*.
